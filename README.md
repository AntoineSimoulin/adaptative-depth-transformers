# Adaptive Depth Transformers

Implementation of the paper "How Many Layers and Why? An Analysis of the Model Depth in Transformers". In this study, we investigate the role of the multiple layers in deep transformer models. We design a variant of ALBERT that  dynamically adapts the number of layers for each token of the input.

## Model architecture

We augment a multi-layer transformer encoder with a halting mechanism, which allows dynamically adjusting the number of layers for each token.
We directly adapted this mechanism from Graves ([2016](#graves-2016)). At each iteration, we compute a probability for each token to stop updating its state.

## Pre-training

We pretrain three models, tiny, small, and base, whose hyper-parameters are detailed below.

| Models  | tiny | small | base |
| :------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| &tau;  | 1e-3 | 5e-4  | 2.5e-4  |
| Max iterations  | 6  | 12  | 24  |
| mlm (Acc.)  |  55.4  |57.1 | 57.4 |
| sop (Acc.)  |  80.9 | 83.9 | 84.3 |
| All tokens  |  3.8 | 7.1 | 10.0 |
| All unmasked tokens  | 3.5 | 6.5 | 9.2 |
| [MASK/MASK]  | 5.8 | 10.9 | 16.0 |
| [MASK/random] | 5.8 | 10.9 | 16.0 |
| [MASK/original] | 4.0 | 7.4 | 10.5 |
| [CLS] | 6.0 | 12.0 | 22.5 |
| [SEP] | 2.5 | 7.6 | 8.4 |

### How to use

We provide a set of demonstration notebooks to use the model:
